# Capstone-Project Stage-1

Project Overview

In the Capstone project, I build an app of my own design in two stages. In Stage 1, I have designed and planned the app.

Creating and building my own app idea can be both exciting and daunting. I'll apply a wealth of different concepts and components that I've learned across the Nanodegree to bring my own app idea to life.

Why this Project?

To become a proficient Android Developer, I need to design apps and make plans for how to implement them. This will involve choices such as how i will store data, how i will display data to the user, and what functionality to include in the app.

What I Learned?

Through this project, I demonstrate the ability to communicate an app idea formally, using:

An app description
UI flow mocks
A list of required tasks that i will do to complete to build the app, in order
The Capstone project will give me the experience i need to own the full development of an app. This first stage replicates the design and planning experience that proficient Android Developers are expected to demonstrate.
